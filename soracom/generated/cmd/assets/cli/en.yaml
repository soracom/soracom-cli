  global-flags:
    api-key: |
      Specify an API key.
      If you do not specify an API key, soracom-cli will perform the authentication process on your behalf to obtain an API key.
      If you already have an API key, you can skip the authentication process by specifying it in this argument to speed up the process.
      --api-token must be specified at the same time.
    api-token: |
      Specify an API token.
      If you do not specify an API token, soracom-cli will perform the authentication process on your behalf to obtain an API token.
      If you already have an API token, you can skip the authentication process by specifying it in this argument to speed up the process.
      --api-key must be specified at the same time.
    auth-key: |
      Specify the AuthKey to be used for the authentication process.
      If both --auth-key-id and --auth-key are specified, soracom-cli will work without pre-configured profiles.
      This means that the 'soracom configure' command does not need to be run beforehand, which is suitable for cases where you only want to run a command temporarily or from a script.
      If you specify this option, you must also specify --coverage-type.
    auth-key-id: |
      Specify AuthKeyId to be used for the authentication process.
      If both --auth-key-id and --auth-key are specified, soracom-cli will work without pre-configured profiles.
      This means that the 'soracom configure' command does not need to be run beforehand, which is suitable for cases where you only want to run a command temporarily or from a script.
      If you specify this option, you must also specify --coverage-type.
    coverage-type: |
      Specify the coverage type, 'g' for Global, 'jp' for Japan.
    no-retry-on-error: |
      If this flag is specified, soracom-cli will not retry even if the API endpoint returns an error. (The default is to retry several times with backoff.)
    profile: |
      Specify a profile name.
    profile-command: |
      Specify a command to supply profile information.
      With this option, soracom-cli will work without pre-configured profiles.
      This means that the 'soracom configure' command does not need to be run beforehand.
      Authentication information can be stored in a more secure location, such as a password manager, and used via external commands.
    raw-output: |
      Outputs the response returned from the API endpoint as-is without processing. (By default, JSON is displayed indented.)
